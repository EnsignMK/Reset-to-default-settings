# Reset to default settins
This extension allows you to revert to the default settings of
Automatic1111 Stable's Webui [AUTOMATIC1111's stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

## Additional Info:


### How does this work?
This is how my customized UI looks like.
You first go to the tab called Default settings

![example_image](show.png)

You press the button Reset settings and afterwards
this appears in the textbox :
> 'Settings are resetted, RESTART REQUIRED'

![example_image](show2.png)

Which means ,it worked, you need to restart the Webui.

>The webui looks like this after the restart:
> ![example](show3.png)


## additional info
If for some reason you don't like the look
of the default webui , you can always go back.
place the config.json and ui-config.json located in
> /extensions/Reset-to-default-settings/scripts
